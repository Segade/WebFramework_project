Repository that contains a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS)  project 

The project consists of a system where users can sign in or sign up for the system. Once they are in, they can see a list of events stored in Atlas MongoDB.

The project uses NodeJS to develop the whole program. For the HTML part Express is used. The events page uses Angular to display the list and accesses the databases through the API. 

Passwords are encrypted in the MongoDB database using the Passport framework. SSL is used in order to use the https protocol.
